# server — Hono HTTP layer

Owns: `server/**`, `scripts/dev.mjs`, `tests/server/**`.

## Running

- `npm run dev` → `scripts/dev.mjs` spawns `node --watch --import tsx/esm server/cli.ts --no-open`
  (`CCA_DEV=1`) and `npx vite` (port 5173, proxies `/api` to 4141). Open http://127.0.0.1:5173/.
  It is deliberately not `tsx watch`: that CLI opens a unix domain socket to its child, which
  sandboxed shells refuse with `EPERM`. `tsx/esm` is the loader half only.
- `npm start` → runs the built `dist/server/cli.js` directly (production: one process on 4141).
- `npm run reindex` → `tsx server/cli.ts --reindex --no-open`: full rebuild, prints a line count,
  exits. Does not start the HTTP server. (`node --import tsx/esm server/cli.ts --reindex
  --no-open` is the equivalent that works without the `tsx` CLI's unix socket.)
- CLI flags: `--port <n>` (default `4141`/`CCA_PORT`), `--no-open`, `--claude-dir <path>`
  (overrides configured roots, also `CCA_CLAUDE_DIR`), `--home <path>` (overrides `CCA_HOME`),
  `--reindex`, `--demo` (see below).
- `--demo [--seed <n>] [--sessions <n>]` — serves the synthetic dataset instead of the user's real
  transcripts, generating it first if `<CCA_HOME>/demo/projects` doesn't exist yet
  (`core/demo/generate.ts`; defaults to the generator's own seed/session count when `--seed`/
  `--sessions` are omitted). Mutually exclusive with `--claude-dir`. Serves exactly as
  `--claude-dir <CCA_HOME>/demo/projects --home <CCA_HOME>/demo/home` would — a dataset and DB
  entirely separate from the user's real one, which this flag never reads or writes. See
  `docs/dev/demo.md` for the on-disk layout and the (pre-existing, separate) `scripts/demo.mjs`/
  `npm run demo`, which does the same thing against the **built** server and is a better fit for
  screenshots/recordings; `--demo` here is for a quick `npm run dev`-style look without a build.

## Layout

- `paths.ts` — resolves `CCA_HOME` (default `~/.claude-cost-analyzer`), `index.sqlite`,
  `config.json`, and transcript roots. `~` expansion, 0700/0600 permissions, path-traversal guard
  (`isInside`) used by `static.ts`.
- `config.ts` — `ConfigStore`: loads/validates/persists `config.json` (`{ pricing, settings }`),
  atomic writes (tmp + rename), `updatePricing`/`resetPricing`/`updateSettings`/`togglePin`.
  Corrupt or schema-invalid config falls back to defaults (`store.warnings`), never crashes.
- `warnings.ts` — filters the one `node:sqlite` `ExperimentalWarning` (SPEC §1.8). It must be the
  **first** import of `cli.ts` and of `worker.ts`: ES modules evaluate imports before the importing
  module's own statements, so a filter written at the top of `cli.ts` runs after `node:sqlite` has
  already loaded and warned. Worker threads get their own warning listeners, which is why the
  worker imports it too (the only `server/` module it may import — it has no dependencies).
- `auth.ts` — `hostGuard` (Host allow-list + Sec-Fetch-Site + Origin, all `/api/*`),
  `sessionAuth` (cookie check, all `/api/*` except `/api/auth/session`; `CCA_ALLOW_UNAUTH_STATUS=1`
  exempts `GET /api/status`), `securityHeaders` (nosniff/CSP/no-referrer/no-store on `/api`).
  One random 32-byte token per process, compared with `timingSafeEqual`. In dev (`CCA_DEV=1`),
  `CCA_DEV_ORIGINS` adds comma-separated extra dev origins to both the Host and Origin lists for
  people running a second Vite server; entries that are not `http(s)` URLs on a loopback host with
  an explicit port are dropped, so a typo cannot widen the allow-list to a routable address.
- `rootsPolicy.ts` — `validateRoots(roots, ccaHome, previousRoots?)`, called from
  `routes/settings.ts` on every `PUT /api/settings`. Rejects a root that isn't an existing
  directory (grandfathered for a root that was already saved and has since disappeared — an
  unrelated settings change, e.g. a theme toggle, must not be blocked by an unmounted drive) or
  that is/contains a sensitive system or credential location (always enforced, no grandfather).
  See "Security model" below.
- `schemas.ts` / `validate.ts` — zod schemas for every query/body, plus `parseQuery`/`parseParams`/
  `parseJsonBody` returning `{ ok: true, data }` or `{ ok: false, response }` (a ready 400
  `Response`, never echoing the raw input).
- `routes/*.ts` — one file per resource; each takes `AppDeps` and returns a `Hono` sub-app mounted
  in `app.ts`. Errors always `{ error: { code, message } }`.
  `routes/status.ts` also fills `StatusResponse.scratchSessions`: `Store.status()` counts rows and
  knows nothing about `hideScratchProjects`, so the route calls `store.listProjects` once more
  with a `QueryContext` whose `settings.hideScratchProjects` is forced to `false` and sums the
  `sessionCount` of the scratch subtree. It runs only while the setting is on, and the field is
  omitted otherwise, so "no scratch filtering" costs nothing.
- `indexing.ts` + `worker.ts` — `IndexManager`: spawns a `worker_threads` Worker per run
  (`worker.ts`), single-flight (`requestFull`/`requestRescan`/`requestIncremental` while a run is
  in progress get coalesced — `full` > `rescan` > `incremental` priority), forwards `progress`
  events to the injected `broadcast`. Worker path resolves relative to `import.meta.url`: `.ts`
  (tsx dev) spawns with `execArgv: ['--import','tsx/esm']`, `.js` (built) spawns plain.
  `IndexManagerOptions` also takes `pricing: () => PricingConfig` (read at the start of every run
  and sent to the worker — indexing needs it for `charsPerToken` in attribution) and an optional
  `onRunComplete(mode, result)`, which `server/index.ts` uses to call `store.reopen()` after a
  `full` rebuild.
- `sse.ts` — `GET /api/events`, 15s ping, per-client write queue via `hono/streaming` `streamSSE`,
  cleaned up on abort. `closeAll()` ends every client itself for shutdown (see "Shutdown" below).
- `watcher.ts` — `fs.watch(root, { recursive: true })` per root, 3s per-file quiet period, batches
  settled paths into `IndexManager.requestIncremental`. Missing roots are logged and skipped, not
  fatal.
- `shutdown.ts` — `createShutdown(deps)`: the `RunningServer.close()` sequence, pulled out of
  `index.ts` so it can be unit-tested against fakes (see "Shutdown" below).
- `static.ts` — serves `dist/web` (resolves to the same directory whether running from
  `server/static.ts` via tsx or `dist/server/static.js`), immutable caching under `/assets/`, SPA
  fallback to `index.html` for other non-`/api` GETs, traversal-safe (`isInside`). When `dist/web`
  does not exist yet, **every route** (any path without a file extension, plus `/index.html`)
  returns the short "run `npm run build`" notice rather than only `/` — reloading `/sessions`
  after `npm start` without a build used to answer a bare `not found`. Requests that look like
  assets still fall through, so a missing file reads as missing.
- `app.ts` — `createApp(deps)`: security headers → hostGuard → auth-session route →
  sessionAuth → API routes → static/SPA. `deps.staticRoot` is test-only (real callers omit it).
- `index.ts` — `startServer(opts)`: wires the real `Store`/`ConfigStore`/`IndexManager`/watcher,
  binds `@hono/node-server` to `127.0.0.1`, returns `{ url, close() }`.
- `cli.ts` — flag parsing, `--reindex` short-circuit (passes the user's `PricingConfig` into
  `runIndex`), opens the browser (`open`, macOS only, unless `--no-open`), graceful
  SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown with a hard fallback exit timer and immediate exit on a second signal
  (see "Shutdown" below), and turns `SqliteFeatureError` into one plain line + exit 1 (the
  wrong-Node-build case). Warning filtering lives in `warnings.ts`, imported first.

## Shutdown

`cli.ts` catches `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, logs one `received <signal>, shutting down` line, and calls
`RunningServer.close()` (built by `server/shutdown.ts`'s `createShutdown`). Order matters and is
what fixed a real hang + a burst of `unhandled error in request handler` logs on Ctrl-C:

1. `watcher.dispose()` and `index.dispose()` (terminates the indexing `Worker`) stop any new work.
2. `sse.closeAll()` ends every open `/api/events` stream *itself* — writes a `bye` frame, then
   closes the writer — instead of leaving an SSE connection for `server.close()` to wait on
   forever (an `EventSource` never closes its side first). `StreamingApi.write`/`writeSSE`
   already swallow their own errors, so this never throws back into the request handler.
3. `server.close(cb)` stops accepting new connections; `closeIdleConnections()` /
   `closeAllConnections()` (Node 18.2+ `http.Server` methods, feature-detected since the
   `ServerType` union also covers `Http2Server`, which lacks them — this app never turns on
   HTTP/2) force-drop anything still open rather than wait on it.
4. `store.close()` runs **last**, only after every connection is confirmed gone. Closing it any
   earlier is what produced the `unhandled error in request handler` lines: an in-flight (or
   force-aborted) request calling into a Store whose DB handle had already been closed underneath
   it.

`cli.ts` also sets an unref'd `setTimeout(() => process.exit(0), 3_000)` as a fallback in case some
unforeseen handle keeps step 3 from resolving, and a second `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` while a shutdown is
already in progress exits immediately rather than waiting out that fallback.

`createShutdown` takes its five dependencies (`watcher`, `index`, `sse`, `store`, `server`) as a
plain object so `tests/server/shutdown.test.ts` can exercise the whole sequence — including
ordering and the `Http2Server`-shaped server without `closeAllConnections` — against fakes, with
no real `listen()`.

## Wiring notes

- `createApp(deps: AppDeps)` is the thing to mount/test. `AppDeps` = `{ store, config, index, sse,
  roots, port, dev, version, ccaHome, staticRoot? }`. `ccaHome` is the resolved, absolute `CCA_HOME`
  (from `paths.ts`); `routes/settings.ts` needs it to keep a new `settings.roots` entry from
  pointing back at the app's own config/DB directory. `store: Store`, `config: ConfigStore` (real class, not
  just the interface — routes call `config.get()/.updatePricing()/...` directly). `roots` is the
  **resolved** root list: `GET /api/status` reports it, because `--claude-dir`/`CCA_CLAUDE_DIR`
  override `settings.roots` and the status pill must show what is actually indexed.
- `IndexManagerLike` (in `indexing.ts`) has `status()`, `requestFull()`, `requestRescan()`,
  `requestIncremental(paths)`, `dispose()`. `requestRescan` runs `runIndex({ full: false })`
  (mtime/size diff across all roots, no explicit path list) — used at boot and for
  `POST /api/reindex` without `{ full: true }`. `requestFull` runs `runIndex({ full: true })`
  (drop + rebuild). `requestIncremental(paths)` runs `indexChangedFiles(paths, …)` (watcher path).
- `createStore(dbPath: string): Store` from `core/db/store.js` is a synchronous factory, as
  assumed; `core/db` landed with the exports in `core/store.ts` and this module typechecks
  against them unchanged.
- `GET /api/sessions/:id`, `/transcript`, `/agents` and `GET /api/export/sessions/:id.json` read
  `?whatIf=` and pass it through `queryContext(config, whatIf)` onto `QueryContext.whatIf`, since
  those four routes have no `RangeQuery` to carry it. Everything else passes its query object
  straight to the Store.

## Gotchas

- `server/worker.ts` must stay free of any import from the rest of `server/` (besides types) —
  it runs in an isolated worker thread.
- Tests never hit the real DB: `tests/server/fake-store.ts` implements `Store` in memory;
  `ConfigStore` tests use a real temp `CCA_HOME` (`mkdtempSync` under `os.tmpdir()`, cleaned up in
  `afterEach`).
- `sessionAuth` special-cases the literal path `/api/auth/session`, not registration order, so it
  works no matter where that route is mounted.

## Security model

This is a single-user, loopback-only tool that indexes and serves the contents of your own Claude
Code transcripts. The threat model is deliberately narrow: **a malicious web page open in the same
browser, or another process on the same machine, trying to read transcript data or repurpose the
indexer** — not a remote attacker (the server only binds `127.0.0.1`) and not a multi-tenant
authorization problem (there is exactly one "user").

**Threats considered and controls:**

- *Another loopback app embedding this UI in an iframe* — opt-in via `CCA_EMBED_ORIGINS`
  (comma-separated loopback parent origins, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). Relaxes CSP
  `frame-ancestors` only; does not add CORS or widen Host/Origin checks. Unset keeps
  `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
- *Cross-site request from a page the user has open, or DNS rebinding to `127.0.0.1`* — `hostGuard`
  requires an exact `Host` match against `127.0.0.1:<port>` / `localhost:<port>` (plus the Vite dev
  origin only when `CCA_DEV=1`); rejects any `Sec-Fetch-Site` other than `same-origin`/`none`; and
  rejects an `Origin` that doesn't match. All three fail closed (403) — confirmed against appended
  subdomains, trailing dots, bracketed/unbracketed IPv6 loopback, missing port, mixed case, and
  decimal/octal/short-form IPv4 rewrites of `127.0.0.1`, none of which match the allow-list string.
- *A page that got past hostGuard reading data anyway* — every other route requires the
  `cca_session` cookie (`HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/`, never `Secure` — this is plain
  `http://127.0.0.1`, and `Secure` would silently stop the browser from ever sending it), one
  random 32-byte token generated fresh per process and compared with `timingSafeEqual`. A cookie
  from a previous process (or a different port) does not authenticate a new one. `GET /api/status`
  is the sole, opt-in (`CCA_ALLOW_UNAUTH_STATUS=1`) exception, for health checks that run before the
  browser has a cookie; it leaks only counts/paths/version, never transcript content.
- *SQL/FTS injection* — every query is a `node:sqlite` prepared statement; table/column names in
  interpolated SQL are always code-level literals (never request input), verified by reading every
  `${...}` in `core/db/*.ts`. Full-text search wraps the user's query as a single quoted FTS5
  phrase (`ftsPhrase`, doubling embedded quotes) before binding it, so FTS operators (`OR`, `NEAR`,
  column filters, `*`) are inert text, not query syntax — confirmed with a real `node:sqlite` FTS5
  table against `DROP TABLE`, unbalanced quotes, and bare operators: all return zero rows, never a
  500, and the table survives.
- *Header injection / path traversal via user-controlled values* — `GET
  /api/export/sessions/:id.json`'s id is validated as a plain token
  (`/^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$/`) before it is embedded in `Content-Disposition`, so a quote or CRLF in the
  id 400s instead of breaking out of the header. Static file serving (`static.ts`) normalizes the
  request path and re-checks it with `isInside(webRoot, target)`; `path.normalize`/`path.join` on
  an always-`/`-rooted request path cannot resolve above the root regardless of `../`, encoded
  `%2e%2e`, or doubled slashes (verified). Symlinks placed inside `dist/web` that point outside it
  are not specially detected (same non-goal as the traversal guard's design) but `dist/web` is
  build output, not attacker-writable through this app.
- *`settings.roots` pointed at something sensitive* — see `rootsPolicy.ts`: rejected unless the
  root is an existing directory that is not, and does not contain as an ancestor relationship,
  a fixed list of system directories (`/etc`, `/var`, `/System`, `/Library`, `/root`, `/proc`,
  `/sys`, `/dev`, …) or per-user credential locations (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.kube`,
  `~/.docker`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.pypirc`, `~/.git-credentials`, `~/.claude` itself, and
  the app's own `CCA_HOME`). `~/.claude/projects` — the documented default root — is explicitly
  carved back out. The "existing directory" half of the check is skipped for a root that was
  already saved and has since disappeared, so an unrelated settings change doesn't get blocked by
  an unmounted drive; the sensitive-location half always runs, on every save, no exceptions.
- *Oversize/malformed request bodies* — `hono/body-limit` caps every `/api/*` body at 1 MiB
  (every real payload — pricing table, settings, `{full}`) is a few KB; a 20 MB body 413s before
  being buffered or parsed. Malformed JSON 400s (`c.req.json()` failure is caught, never a bare
  500). `__proto__`/`constructor` keys in a JSON body are inert: `JSON.parse` creates them as
  ordinary own properties (verified — this is standard JS engine behavior, not something this app
  does), and zod strips unrecognized keys regardless.
- *Information leakage on error* — every route returns `{ error: { code, message } }`; `message`
  is always a fixed string, never the request input, a stack trace, or a DB error. An uncaught
  throw inside a route handler (`app.onError`) is normalized to the same envelope; only the
  error's *constructor name* is logged server-side (e.g. `TypeError`), never `.message`/`.stack`,
  so a bug that surfaced a fragment of transcript content inside an error message can't leak it
  into the log either. `GET /api/status` includes `dbPath` — accepted as fine for a single-user
  local tool (it's the path to the user's own machine's own file) but nothing else there is
  sensitive.
- *Resource exhaustion* — the indexing `Worker` is watched for `message`/`error`/`exit`; a worker
  that dies without ever posting a terminal message (OOM kill, a native crash, `process.exit()`
  inside the worker) is treated as a crash via the `exit` listener, not a silent hang that leaves
  `indexing: true` forever and swallows every future reindex request. SSE (`sse.ts`) frees a
  client's resources the moment its response stream is cancelled (a real disconnect at the
  `@hono/node-server` layer); verified with 50 concurrent connections opened and then cancelled,
  `clientCount()` returns to 0.
- *Silent request misinterpretation* — `POST /api/reindex` reads its body by content, not by
  trusting a `Content-Length` header to decide whether one is present: that header is absent on a
  chunked-transfer request even though the request is not, in fact, bodyless, which used to
  silently downgrade `{ "full": true }` to a plain rescan with a `200 { started: true }` response
  that gave no indication anything had gone differently than asked.

**Non-goals (by design, given the threat model above):**

- No protection against a local, code-executing attacker on the same machine (they already have
  more direct access than this server exposes) or against the OS user account itself.
- No CSRF token beyond the Host/Origin/Sec-Fetch-Site checks — there is nothing session-scoped to
  forge across users, and a same-site/no-header request already has to originate from this origin
  or from no browser context at all.
- No rate limiting: this is a single local client talking to a local server.
- No TLS: loopback-only, no data leaves the machine (SPEC §1.2), so there is no network path to
  encrypt.
