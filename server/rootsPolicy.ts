/**
 * Policy for `settings.roots` (the directories the indexer walks for transcripts), enforced on
 * `PUT /api/settings`. Two rules, both server-side because `core/settings.ts`'s zod schema only
 * checks shape ("a non-empty array of non-empty strings"), not filesystem meaning:
 *
 *  1. Every root must resolve (after `~` expansion) to a directory that exists right now. A
 *     typo'd or not-yet-mounted path is rejected at save time rather than silently indexing
 *     nothing (the watcher already tolerates a root that *disappears* later — see watcher.ts —
 *     this is only about what you're allowed to configure).
 *  2. No root may be, or contain as an ancestor relationship, a well-known sensitive location:
 *     OS/system directories, and per-user credential/secret directories and files. This is a
 *     single-user tool that walks arbitrary directory trees and full-text-indexes every line of
 *     every file that looks like a transcript into a local SQLite DB; pointing it at `/`, `/etc`,
 *     or `~/.ssh` would happily index (and make searchable, in `messages_fts`) the contents of
 *     those files. `~/.claude` itself is denied (it holds this account's own credentials/oauth
 *     state next to the transcripts), but `~/.claude/projects` — the documented default root —
 *     is explicitly carved back out since it is a normal descendant of the denied path, not an
 *     ancestor of anything sensitive.
 *
 * Non-goals: this does not stop a root from containing *unrelated* non-sensitive private files
 * (that's the point of the feature), and it does not follow symlinks to detect a link that
 * escapes to a sensitive target after the fact — same non-goal as `static.ts`'s traversal guard.
