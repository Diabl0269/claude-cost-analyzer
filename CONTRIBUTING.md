# Contributing

Thanks for looking at Claude Cost Analyzer. This is a local, single-user web app that reads Claude
Code transcripts from `~/.claude/projects` and prices every request, tool call, subagent, workflow,
hook and harness injection at API list prices. The full design is `SPEC.md` (binding); the cost
model is explained in `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`; per-module notes live in `docs/dev/*.md`.

## Node 22, always

`node:sqlite` is the app's only database driver and the index needs FTS5 (trigram tokenizer);
Node 23's bundled SQLite lacks it. Start every shell session with `nvm use` (`.nvmrc` pins 22), or:

```sh
export PATH="$(dirname "$(nvm which 22)"):$PATH"
```

`npx tsx` can hang in a sandboxed shell — the `tsx` CLI opens a unix domain socket to talk to its
child process, which a sandbox may refuse. Run TypeScript one-offs with
`node --import tsx/esm <file>.ts` instead; that's the loader half only, no socket.

## Commands

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | server (4141, `CCA_DEV=1`) + Vite (5173) via `scripts/dev.mjs`; starts local servers |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -p tsconfig.node.json && vite build` → `dist/` |
| `npm start` | runs the built `dist/server/cli.js`; starts a local server |
| `npm test` | vitest, all against fakes/fixtures, never a real transcript DB |
| `npm run test:e2e` | builds, boots the server on 4171 against `tests/fixtures/projects`, Playwright + axe; starts a local server and a browser |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsconfig.node.json` + `tsconfig.web.json` + `tsconfig.tests.json` |
| `npm run validate` | `scripts/validate-cost-state.ts` — cross-checks computed cost vs Claude Code's `cost-state` tally |
| `npm run screenshot` | `scripts/screenshot.ts` — every page, both themes, into `docs/screenshots/`; needs a running server and a browser |
| `npm run demo` | `scripts/demo.mjs` — generates the synthetic demo dataset (once) and serves it on 4142 from its own `CCA_HOME`; `--fresh`, `--seed`, `--sessions`, `--port`, `--no-open` |
| `npm run demo:data -- --out <dir>` | `scripts/gen-demo-data.ts` — deterministic synthetic `~/.claude/projects`-shaped tree (`core/demo/`) |
| `npm run demo:video -- --base <url> --out docs/demo` | `scripts/demo-video.ts` — narrated Playwright tour → mp4/webm/gif/poster (`docs/dev/demo-video.md`) |
| `npm run check:privacy` | `scripts/check-privacy.mjs` — fails on emails, foreign `/Users/<name>` paths, Slack IDs, and tokens listed in the git-ignored `.privacy-denylist.local` |

Loopback curl and any Playwright run need network/loopback access, which a sandboxed shell may not
grant by default.

Ports and homes are all overridable, so more than one checkout can run at once without colliding:
`CCA_PORT` / `CCA_VITE_PORT` / `CCA_HOME` / `CCA_CLAUDE_DIR` for `npm run dev`, and `CCA_E2E_PORT` /
`CCA_E2E_HOME` for `npm run test:e2e`. `dist/` is shared — never run two builds at once.

## Layout

```
core/                 pure TypeScript, no HTTP, no React — types.ts is the shared contract
  types.ts            domain + API types. Append-only; never rename or repurpose a field.
  discover.ts jsonl.ts parse/    JSONL → ParsedSession        (parser module)
  pricing/ cost/ db/             pricing table, attribution, SQLite index, queries  (cost/index module)
  demo/                          seeded synthetic dataset generator (pure; no real data)  (docs/dev/demo.md)
server/               Hono app: routes, auth, indexing worker, SSE, fs watcher, CLI
web/                  Vite + React 19 UI ("The Ledger"): components, routes, design tokens
scripts/              dev.mjs, demo.mjs, gen-demo-data.ts, demo-video.ts (+ demo-video/), screenshot.ts, validate-cost-state.ts, check-privacy.mjs
tests/                core/** (vitest), fixtures/projects (synthetic), e2e/** (Playwright)
docs/                 METHODOLOGY.md, dev/*.md, screenshots/ (demo data), demo/ (video), executive-summary.html
```

Detailed per-module notes: `docs/dev/parse.md`, `docs/dev/cost-db.md`, `docs/dev/server.md`,
`docs/dev/web.md`, `docs/dev/integration.md`, `docs/dev/validation.md`.

## Shared contracts

- `core/types.ts` is the contract between every module. Extend it, don't fork it — new fields are
  additive.
- `core/store.ts` / `core/db/store.ts`: `createStore(dbPath)` implements every read/write query the
  server uses. Routes call `Store` methods, never raw SQL.

## Conventions

- ESM everywhere; imports use explicit `.js` extensions (even from `.ts` sources).
- Web code uses `@/` (→ `web/src`) and `@core/` (→ `core`) aliases — **except** `web/src/lib/*`
  modules also imported directly by a test (`format.ts`, `range.ts`): those need relative imports
  with an explicit `.js` so they compile under both `tsconfig.web.json` (Bundler resolution) and
  `tsconfig.tests.json` (NodeNext, no aliases).
- Dependencies are frozen to `package.json`. Don't add or upgrade one without a license check (no
  GPL in this project); if something's missing, stop and raise it before installing.
- **Money is computed at read time and never stored.** Only token counts (integers) live in the
  DB; every dollar figure is `tokens × current PricingConfig`, so editing prices or a what-if swap
  never needs a re-index.
- Estimated numbers are always labelled **est.** in the UI (`<EstimateBadge>`); exact numbers never
  carry it.
- No real transcript content anywhere outside your own `~/.claude/projects`: fixtures under
  `tests/fixtures` are synthetic, hand-computed totals live in `tests/fixtures/README.md`, and logs
  /docs/error messages never echo transcript text.

## Design brief

`SPEC.md` §8 ("The Ledger") is binding, not inspiration. New pages compose the components
documented in `docs/dev/web.md` (`LedgerTable`, `Receipt`, `Kpi`, `CostWaterfall`, `ContextStrip`,
`ModelChip`, `EstimateBadge`, …) — don't hand-roll a table or a chart that already has a component.

## Validation oracle

Claude Code's own `cost-state` lines are a per-**process** running tally, not a per-session one: a
resumed, forked or continued session can start that counter already holding a parent's total, or
reset it while the transcript keeps the whole history. `core/cost/reported.ts` classifies each
session's comparison (`match`, `tally-includes-earlier-process`, `file-covers-more-than-tally`,
`hidden-calls-only`, `mixed`) rather than pass/failing it — see `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` §2 and
`docs/dev/validation.md` for the current numbers.

## Schema version bump = rebuild

The DB is a rebuildable cache keyed by `PRAGMA user_version` (currently `SCHEMA_VERSION = 3`). A
mismatch drops and recreates every table on next open — there are no migrations. Bump it whenever
`core/db/schema.ts` changes shape.

## How to add things

- **A page**: `web/src/routes/<name>/Page.tsx` (default export, one `<h1>`), register it in
  `web/src/app/routes.tsx` with `lazyPage(...)` and a `handle.title`. See `docs/dev/web.md` §"Adding
  a page" for the full checklist (rail slot, shortcuts, loading/empty/error states).
- **An endpoint**: add a route file under `server/routes/`, a zod schema in `server/schemas.ts`, and
  a matching type in `core/types.ts` §API. Validate query/body with `parseQuery`/`parseJsonBody`
  before touching the store; never echo raw input in an error.
- **A pricing entry**: append to the table in `core/pricing/defaults.ts` per `SPEC.md` §5.2 (label,
  prefix match, per-token prices, fast-mode prices if any, chars/token); `findModelPrice` picks the
  longest prefix match, so order doesn't matter but specificity does.

## Gates before a pull request

1. `npm run typecheck` clean.
2. `npm test` green.
3. If you touched `web/**`, `core/**`, or anything the built server serves: `npm run test:e2e`
   green (this also runs `npm run build`).
4. Never modify `package.json`, tsconfigs, or `SPEC.md` without discussion first. Never write under
   `~/.claude` or `~/.claude-cost-analyzer` during dev/test — use a scratch `CCA_HOME` and your own
   port, and stop every process you started.
5. `node scripts/check-privacy.mjs` must exit 0 — no real names, paths, or transcript content.
